# Ballot Retrieval

After the audit begins, each jurisdiction with ballots selected will receive a ballot retrieval list. Generally this list is downloaded by the jurisdiction retrieving the ballots from Arlo, the audit software ([see instructions above](../jurisdiction-manager/audit-conduct-1/audit-conduct.md)) but sometimes it may be sent to a county by the state or to a local jurisdiction by their county.

To retrieve ballots, refer to your ballot retrieval list to determine which container is needed.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Ballot Polling" %}
Retrieving ballots for a ballot polling risk-limiting audit is really as simple and straight-forward as retrieving the correct ballot container and counting to the ballot randomly selected. \

Each ballot retrieval list will show the container and the associated ballot number for each ballot that needs to be retrieved.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ballot Comparison/Hybrid" %}
Retrieving ballots for a ballot comparison risk-limiting audit is a very precise task.

Each ballot retrieval list will show the container, the tabulator, the batch name, the ballot number to be retrieved, and where applicable, the imprinted ID.&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Retrieve the correct container and perform required chain of custody verification steps. Then open the container. Pull the entire batch of ballots out of the storage container.  They should be well organized but may need to be manipulated into a stack of ballots that is mostly neat.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note**: for ballot comparison audits the ballots must be pulled out in the exact order they were stored.
{% endhint %}

Next refer back to the Ballot Number column of your retrieval list for the ballot number (or numbers) that you need. Start counting at one and stop counting when you get to the ballot number that you are retrieving. &#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** for ballot comparison audits verify the imprint ID on the retrieval list with the ballot when applicable.
{% endhint %}

Once you count to the ballot number on your retrieval list, pull the ballot out of the stack, place a colored sheet of paper in the ballot's place to serve as a placeholder, and stick a removable label on to the ballot. The placeholder and label can be generated from Arlo, but if they are not, use blank stock and write the batch name and ballot number on each. Put the retrieved ballot to the side until all ballots have been retrieved.

If more than one ballot is needed from the batch, keep counting until you have retrieved all of the ballots. Always double check the batch name with the retrieval list to ensure it is the same container.

{% hint style="info" %}
When a duplicated ballot is retrieved, the original ballot should also be retrieved and used in the tally process.
{% endhint %}

Once the ballots have been retrieved from a container, reseal the container (keeping the ballots selected out) and complete any required chain of custody documentation.
