# Cast Vote Records (CVRs)

In order to conduct a ballot comparison or hybrid risk-limiting audit, Arlo needs the Cast Vote Record (CVR) file from your EMS system.  Most EMS systems have a CVR export function. Contact your vendor for instructions on how to export the CVR file. When conducting a hybrid risk limiting audit, be sure to only upload the CVRs for those ballots marked with a Y in the ballot manifest CVR column.\
