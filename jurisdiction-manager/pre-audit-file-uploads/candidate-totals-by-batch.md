# Candidate Totals by Batch

In order to conduct a batch comparison risk limiting audit, Arlo needs candidate vote totals for each batch.&#x20;

Open a spreadsheet program and create a simple spreadsheet.&#x20;

* Column A labeled “Batch Name” is for your batch name - this must match the batch names in your ballot manifest
* Additional columns should be labeled with the names of the target contest candidates or selections.  Your audit administrator will provide this information to you.

Enter the data for your county or jurisdiction. When you're finished, take a second to ensure the total number of batches matches your number of batches in your ballot manifest and that the candidate totals are correct.  Then save the file as a .csv file. \
