# Batch Tally Entry into Arlo

The tallies for each batch selected for audit must be entered into Arlo to conclude the audit. Tallies can be entered by audit boards, specified tally entry users, and/or jurisdiction managers.

To create tally entry accounts for audit boards or specified tally entry users, select Set Up Tally Entry Accounts on the Set Up Tally Entry Accounts screen. If the Jurisdiction Manager will be entering tallies, select Skip.

The Jurisdiction Manager should provide the Tally Entry User(s) with the login link displayed on the screen (each link is unique to the jurisdiction). Then the Tally Entry User(s) should log in by entering their name(s) and party affiliation (if required).  A login code will be provided, the Jurisdiction Manager should enter that code to authenticate the Tally Entry User(s) by selecting Enter Login Code, entering the code, and selecting Confirm to complete the login process.
