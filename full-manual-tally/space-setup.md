# Space Setup

A room or facility where ballots can be reviewed securely is important.

**At minimum**, the room will need a 6’ table and chairs for each of the following:

* Ballot container check-in/out station (2 chairs)
* Each audit board (2 chairs)
* Each Vote Review Panel (3 chairs)
* A sign-in station for public and monitors (1 chair)

The following is a suggested layout for four audit boards with a monitor. Observation is best done in front of the audit board tables.
