# Audit Roles

A number of people will be necessary to ensure ballots are tallied accurately. The full manual tally requires four roles and each role is defined below to assist with the tasks required.

## **Role #1 - Superintendent**

The role of the Superintendent is to ensure the audit process is running smoothly and answer questions about the process. The Superintendent should not be assigned to one of the roles below, to ensure that they are free to troubleshoot and assist the Vote Review Panel as needed. Superintendents in counties with many audit boards may authorize one or more designees to assist with questions. Any designees should be responsible for a specific set of audit boards.

## **Role #2 - Check-In/Out Station**

At a minimum, two people are needed to check ballots in/out to audit boards for chain of custody as well as keep inventory of the ballot containers audited. One person should be stationed with the ballot containers at all times while another person delivers containers to and from the audit boards (a “runner”). This keeps the audit boards stationary and provides a methodical process for keeping track of each container. If you have more than a few audit boards, be sure to add an additional runner for every 5 audit boards to ensure the delivery and pick-up of ballot containers is not a bottleneck in the process.

Please see the Check-In/Check-Out Station Guide for more detail on Check-In/Out procedure:

## **Role #3 - Audit Boards**

Audit boards must be comprised of two people and will be responsible for sorting and tallying the votes in the Presidential race for each ballot in a batch. Be sure to keep tables clear of anything (especially food and beverage) other than ballots and required documentation. Audit Board members will direct _any and all_ procedural questions to the Election Superintendent or their designee by raising their question mark sign.

## **Role #4 - Vote Review Panel**

Various types of ballots will be delivered to the Vote Review Panel after an audit board has completed their work.
