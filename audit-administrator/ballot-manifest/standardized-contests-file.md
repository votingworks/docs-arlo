# Standardized Contests File

A standardized contests file tells Arlo which contests to expect and their correct names. A standardized contest file is also a two column spreadsheet. The first column titled “Contest Name” and the second column titled “Jurisdictions.”  The contest name column should be populated with the contest names exactly as entered in your EMS system and the jurisdiction column should list each participant that has the contest on their ballots. If all participants have the contest, type “all.” Save the spreadsheet as a .csv file.

1. Select Browse and locate the standardized contests .csv file created.
2. Select Upload File.
3. Select Next.
