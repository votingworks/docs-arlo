# Participants

In order to begin the audit, Arlo needs to know the participants. A participant (or [Jurisdiction Manager](../../user-roles.md)) is usually a county or local jurisdiction responsible for creating their own pre-audit files and coordinating the retrieval of ballots. Prepare a participant list by creating a two column spreadsheet. The first column titled “Jurisdiction” and the second column titled “Admin Email.”  The email address should be the email the user wants to use to retrieve login information. Save the spreadsheet as a .csv file.&#x20;

When the spreadsheet is ready, complete the steps in the Participants section of Arlo, as follows:

1. Select Browse and locate the participants .csv file created.
2. Select Upload File.
3. Select Next.

The completion of this step allows participants to begin to upload pre-audit files into Arlo. The remaining setup tasks may be completed during the upload process and before the audit begins.
