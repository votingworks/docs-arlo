Below the map on the Audit Progress screen is a list of all jurisdictions and the various stages in the upload process they've completed.

Ballots in Manifest is the total number of ballots the jurisdiction has in their manifest. This should match their number of ballots tabulated. If the expected ballots were entered into the Participant file, that column will also be displayed with a third column showing the difference.

Information on the progress screen can be sorted in many different ways, as well as downloaded into a .csv file.  Sort order will be maintained when the screen is refreshed.

Use Download Reported Results to download the reported results summed by jurisdiction. This is useful when comparing uploaded results with another data source.&#x20;
