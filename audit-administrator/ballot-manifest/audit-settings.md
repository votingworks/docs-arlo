**Note:** for ballot polling audits, you'll also select how the audit boards will enter data.&#x20;

**Online** - audit boards enter the marks of each ballot using an internet connected device. (Recommended)

**Offline** - audit boards use a tally sheet to record the marks of each ballot. Tally sheet totals are entered into Arlo.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

At this point the audit is ready to begin if all jurisdictions have uploaded the required files. Check the top of the screen for jurisdiction file upload progress before selecting Save & Next.
