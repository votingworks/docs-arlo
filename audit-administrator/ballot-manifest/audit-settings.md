# Audit Settings

In the final audit settings, your state should already be set as a default but if not, select it from the drop down. The State populates the map in the Audit Progress Screen.  Next enter the Election Name, designate the desired risk limit, and enter the random seed.&#x20;

The risk limit may be designated in state statute or rule. Be sure to verify your state's requirements.

Presentation mode may be used when entering the random seed to a public audience. Select Presentation Mode and a larger box only meant for random seed entry will open.  Select Set Random Seed to save it after it's entered.

**Note:** for ballot polling audits, you'll also select how the audit boards will enter data.&#x20;

**Online** - audit boards enter the marks of each ballot using an internet connected device. (Recommended)

**Offline** - audit boards use a tally sheet to record the marks of each ballot. Tally sheet totals are entered into Arlo.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

At this point the audit is ready to begin if all jurisdictions have uploaded the required files. Check the top of the screen for jurisdiction file upload progress before selecting Save & Next.
