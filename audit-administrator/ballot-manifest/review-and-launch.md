# Review & Launch

After all setup screens are completed and all jurisdictions have uploaded their files, it is time to launch the audit. &#x20;

First, take a moment to review all of the audit settings for accuracy.  Arlo provides all of the details for final review.

**Note**: For **ballot comparison** and **hybrid** audits, some contest names in the CVR files may not match the standardized contest names. To match contest names to the CVR files, simply click on Standardize Contest Names.\

And match the contests not found with the contest name in the CVR file.

{% tab title="Ballot Polling" %}
For ballot polling audits, the BRAVO (Ballot-polling Risk-limiting Audits to Verify Outcome) sample size is the most efficient number of ballots the RLA math thinks is necessary to complete the audit. Some jurisdictions choose to use that sample size knowing there is a higher possibility of needing to do an additional round of sampling to attain the risk limit. Arlo provides options, allowing you to pick a larger sample size for the first round to create a smaller possibility of retrieving ballots in a second round.

{% tab title="Hybrid" %}
For a hybrid audit, Arlo will display the number of ballots in the sample that have CVRs and are subject to the ballot comparison math and the number of ballots without CVRs and subject to the ballot polling math.

When the margin of the contest being audited is close and over 25% of the ballots are required to be sampled, Arlo will automatically revert to a full hand tally and your sample size will be reflected as all ballots.
