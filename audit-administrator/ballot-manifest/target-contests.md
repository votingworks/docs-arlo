# Target Contests

The target contests are the required contests to be audited.  Target contests will drive the ballot retrieval sample size and require the risk limit to be met.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Ballot Polling/Batch Comparison/Hybrid" %}
For each targeted contest, youâ€™ll enter the contest name, number of winners, number of votes allowed, the name and votes for each candidate, and total number of ballots cast (not required for batch comparison). \
\
Write-in candidates should also be included if any were awarded votes. Generally only a single "Write-In Candidate" category is needed.\
\
The total ballot cards cast _**should be the total number of ballots in your ballot manifest**_, even ballots that do not contain the contest.

If a contest has more than two choices, select Add a new candidate/choice to add more lines.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** for **hybrid** audits, the Contest Name field will be a drop down menu populated from the standardized contest file. &#x20;

For **batch comparison** audits, the Names of Candidates/Choices will drive the required candidate headers in the contest totals by batch file. The [candidate totals by batch file'](../../jurisdiction-manager/pre-audit-file-uploads/candidate-totals-by-batch.md)s headers must match the candidate names entered at this step.
{% endhint %}

The last step in setting up a targeted contest is to select which jurisdictions have that contest on the ballot.&#x20;

1. Select Select Jurisdictions
2. If the contest is in all jurisdictions, use the Select all checkbox. Otherwise, select jurisdictions individually.
3. Select Save & Next

If more than one contest is targeted for audit, use the Add another targeted contest button to add additional targeted contests before selecting Save & Next.\

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ballot Comparison" %}
Arlo populates the contests based on the standardized contest file. Simply select the contest(s) being targeted from the list.
