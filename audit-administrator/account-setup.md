# Account Setup

Enter your email address when prompted. Click on Forgot password? and a verification code will be sent to your email address for use as your password. Use the verification code as prompted to complete the login process.  Future logins will not require the password reset.

After you have reset the password and logged in, Arlo will prompt you to set up multi-factor authentication with the authentication application of your choice.  Follow the prompts on screen.
