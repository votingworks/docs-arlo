# Audit Completion

When all audit boards or jurisdiction managers have completed their ballot or batch entry and the risk limit has been met, the audit administrator finishes the round by selecting the Finish Round x button. This allows for discrepancy review before officially completing the round.

If the round completes the audit, the Audit Progress screen will display the message “Congratulations - the audit is complete!”  Select the Download Audit Report button for a report that includes all of the audit data, including the risk measurement.

### **Additional Sampling**

If the risk limit was not met after all ballots have been audited, Arlo will immediately escalate to an additional round of sampling. A new ballot retrieval list, placeholders, labels, and audit board credentials will be generated for each jurisdiction required to retrieve more ballots. Use the Start round x button to start the next round.
