# Audit Completion

When all audit boards have completed their ballot entry and the risk limit has been met, the Audit Progress screen will display the message “Congratulations - the audit is complete!”  Click on the Download Audit Report button for a report that includes all of the audit data, including the risk measurement.

### **Additional Sampling**

If the risk limit was not met after all ballots have been audited, Arlo will immediately escalate to an additional round of sampling. A new ballot retrieval list, placeholders, labels, and audit board credentials will be generated for each jurisdiction required to retrieve more ballots. Use the Start round x button to start the next round.
